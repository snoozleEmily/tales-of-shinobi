[Game Manual]

This is a single-player, text-based interactive story game inspired by the Naruto manga and anime series. In this fan-made game, we explore the multi-verse theory, in which players make choices that significantly influence the game's outcome, diverging from the original Naruto storyline.

Please note that this game is currently in development, and as such, we are unable to provide complete instructions on how to play it at this time. We appreciate your interest and look forward to updating this documentation with comprehensive gameplay instructions as the game progresses.

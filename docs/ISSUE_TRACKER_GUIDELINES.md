# Issue Tracker Guidelines

Welcome to the Issue Tracker for Tales Of Shinobi! Our issue tracker is a valuable tool for improving the game and enhancing the player's experience. To ensure that the issue tracker remains organized and efficient, please follow these guidelines:

## Reporting Issues

### 1. **Search Before Reporting**

   - Before creating a new issue, please search the existing issues to check if the problem or feature request has already been reported or discussed. Duplicates can clutter the tracker.

### 2. **Clear and Descriptive Titles**

   - Provide a clear and concise title that accurately summarizes the issue or feature request. Avoid vague or overly generic titles.

### 3. **Detailed Information**

   - When reporting a bug or issue, please provide the following detailed information to help us understand and address the problem effectively:

     - **Steps to Reproduce**:
       - Clearly outline the specific actions and sequence of events that lead to the issue. Be as detailed as possible to help us recreate the problem.

     - **Screenshots**:
       - Whenever applicable, attach screenshots that illustrate the issue. A visual representation can be immensely helpful in identifying the problem.

     - **Expected Behavior**:
       - Describe what you expected to happen when you performed the actions that triggered the issue. This helps us understand your intended outcome.

     - **Actual Behavior**:
       - Explain what actually happened when you followed the steps mentioned above. Be precise and provide details about the issue's outcome.

     - **Error Messages or Logs**:
       - If the issue produced any error messages or logs, please include them in your report. These logs can contain valuable information about the problem's root cause.

     - **Game Version and Platform**:
       - Specify the version of the game you are playing, as well as the platform or environment you are using (e.g., Windows or macOS). This information assists us in isolating platform-specific issues.

   Providing comprehensive details in your bug reports greatly aids us in reproducing, and addressing issues. Your assistance is valuable in enhancing the quality of Tales Of Shinobi. Thank you!

### 4. **Use Labels Appropriately**

   - Our issue tracker uses labels to categorize issues. Please choose the most appropriate label for your issue. If you're unsure which label to use, our maintainers will help categorize it.

### 5. **Be Courteous and Respectful**

   - Maintain a respectful and constructive tone in your issue descriptions and comments. Harassment, rudeness, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Commenting on Issues

### 1. **Stay On-Topic**

   - Keep discussions within an issue focused on the issue's subject. If you have a different question or concern, consider creating a new issue or using the appropriate community channels.

### 2. **Provide Constructive Feedback**

   - Offer helpful insights, suggestions, or solutions that contribute to resolving the issue. Avoid posting "+1" or "+100" comments, as they don't add value.

### 3. **Respect Maintainer Decisions**

   - Our maintainers make decisions based on the best interests of the project. Disagreements are welcome but should be expressed respectfully.

### 4. **Minimize Chatter**

   - Excessive discussions or off-topic chatter can make it difficult to follow important updates on the issue. Use discretion when commenting.
